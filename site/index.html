    <h1>Dieter Rams: Ten Principles For Good Design</h1>
    <h2>1st Principle: Good Design is innovative</h2>
    <p>
      The possibilities for progression are not, by any means, exhausted.
      Technological development is always offering new opportunities for
      original designs. But imaginative design always develops in tandem with
      improving technology, and can never be an end in itself.
    </p>

    <h2>2nd Principle: Good Design makes a product useful</h2>
    <p>
      A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy not only functional, but
      also psychological and aesthetic criteria. Good design emphasizes the
      usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could detract
      from it.
    </p>

    <h2>3rd Principle: Good Design is aesthetic</h2>
    <p>
      The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because
      products we use every day affect our person and our well-being. But only
      well-executed objects can be beautiful.
    </p>

    <h2>4th Principle: Good Design makes a product understandable</h2>
    <p>
      It clarifies the products structure. Better still, it can make the product
      talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.
    </p>

    <h2>5th Principle: Good Design is unobtrusive</h2>
    <p>
      Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative
      objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral
      and restrained, to leave room for the users self-expression.
    </p>

    <h2>6th Principle: Good Design is honest</h2>
    <p>
      It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it
      really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises
      that cannot be kept.
    </p>

    <h2>7th Principle: Good Design is long-lasting</h2>
    <p>
      It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike
      fashionable design, it lasts many years - even in today's throwaway
      society.
    </p>

    <h2>8th Principle: Good Design is thorough down to the last detail</h2>
    <p>
      Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the
      design process show respect towards the consumer.
    </p>

    <h2>9th Principle: Good Design is environmentally friendly</h2>
    <p>
      Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the
      environment. It conserves resources and minimises physical and visual
      pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.
    </p>

    <h2>10th Principle: Good Design is as little design as possible</h2>
    <p>
      Less, but better - because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and
      the products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to
      simplicity.
